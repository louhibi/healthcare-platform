# Healthcare Management Platform

A comprehensive, production-ready healthcare management platform built with microservices architecture for hospitals, clinics, and medical practices.

## üè• Overview

This platform provides essential healthcare management capabilities including patient management, appointment scheduling, user authentication, and role-based access control. Built with modern technologies and designed for scalability, security, and ease of use.

### Key Features

- **Patient Management**: Complete patient profiles with medical history, insurance, and emergency contacts
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Smart scheduling with conflict detection and availability management
- **User Management**: Role-based authentication (Admin, Doctor, Nurse, Staff)
- **API Gateway**: Centralized routing, authentication, and rate limiting
- **Microservices Architecture**: Scalable and maintainable service separation
- **Production Ready**: Docker containerization, health checks, and monitoring

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Microservices

- **API Gateway** (Port 8080): Request routing, authentication, rate limiting
- **User Service** (Port 8081): Authentication, user management, JWT tokens
- **Patient Service** (Port 8082): Patient CRUD operations, search, medical records
- **Appointment Service** (Port 8083): Scheduling, conflict detection, availability

### Technology Stack

**Backend**
- Go 1.21 with Gin framework
- PostgreSQL (separate DB per service)
- JWT authentication
- Redis caching
- RESTful APIs

**Frontend**
- Vue.js 3 with Composition API
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Pinia for state management
- Axios for API communication

**Infrastructure**
- Docker & Docker Compose
- NGINX load balancing
- Health checks and monitoring
- PgAdmin for database management

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
